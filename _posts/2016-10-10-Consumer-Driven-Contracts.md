Like many tech companies, at my employer we have a spiderâ€™s web of internal services communicating over HTTP. Services call other services. The website calls services. Our iOS and Android apps use these services. The services are owned by a number of different teams, and the apps are owned by entirely separate teams. 

Consumer-driven contracts is a pattern that seeks to reduce the risk of maintaining services by explicitly documenting and testing the dependencies between them. We adopted consumer-driven contracts around a year ago, after the technique appeared on the [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/pact-pacto). 

I've [posted](https://engineering.moonpig.com/development/consumer-driven-contracts) about our experience on our [engineering blog](https://engineering.moonpig.com/).
